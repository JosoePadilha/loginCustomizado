This application aims to demonstrate in a very simple way (using only a middleware, without request validations, ...) the redirection of clients and users of a system depending on their access level with 5 login attempts. After these attempts, you will need to wait 1 minute to try again. To get the return messages, install dependencies (toasr only, https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr).
